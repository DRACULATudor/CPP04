# C++ Module 04 Overview

## Introduction

C++ Module 04 is typically part of a series of lessons or courses designed to teach advanced C++ programming concepts. In this module, you will learn about more complex features of C++, building upon the foundation of the previous modules. This module focuses on object-oriented programming (OOP), dynamic memory management, and advanced techniques for managing data and resources effectively in C++.

## Compilation

```
Compile the project:
```
make
```
Or, if there is no Makefile:
```
c++ -Wall -Wextra -Werror -std=c++98 *.cpp -o program
```
Run the program:
```
./exec_name(check Makefile)

```
# Usage
```
Run the compiled program to test basic C++ concepts, such as input/output handling, loops, and basic functions.
```

## Topics Covered

### 1. **Classes and Objects**
   - **Definition of Classes**: A class is a blueprint for creating objects, providing initial values for state (member variables), and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods).
   - **Objects**: An object is an instance of a class. It is a collection of variables and functions bundled together to model real-world entities.

### 2. **Constructors and Destructors**
   - **Constructors**: Special member functions used to initialize objects of a class.
   - **Destructors**: Special member functions that are used to clean up resources when an object goes out of scope or is destroyed.

### 3. **Dynamic Memory Allocation**
   - Understanding the use of `new` and `delete` operators in C++ to dynamically allocate and deallocate memory.
   - Proper memory management to avoid memory leaks and dangling pointers.

### 4. **Operator Overloading**
   - The ability to define how operators (such as `+`, `-`, `=`, etc.) work for user-defined types (classes).

### 5. **Copy Constructor**
   - The copy constructor is a special constructor used to create a new object as a copy of an existing object.
   - Important for passing objects by value or returning objects from functions.

### 6. **Deep and Shallow Copy**
   - Understanding the difference between shallow copy (default behavior) and deep copy (manual handling of dynamic memory).

### 7. **Inheritance**
   - Inheritance is a mechanism to create new classes from existing ones, allowing code reuse and establishing a relationship between the parent (base) class and the child (derived) class.
   - Types of inheritance (single, multiple, multilevel).

### 8. **Polymorphism**
   - The ability to use a base class pointer or reference to call derived class methods.
   - Achieved through virtual functions and function overriding.

### 9. **Encapsulation and Abstraction**
   - **Encapsulation**: Hiding the internal details of an object and providing access through public methods.
   - **Abstraction**: Hiding the complexity and only showing the essential features of an object.

### 10. **Memory Management Best Practices**
   - Proper use of smart pointers (like `std::unique_ptr` and `std::shared_ptr` in C++) to handle memory automatically and safely.
   - Prevention of memory leaks, resource management, and best practices in dynamic memory handling.

## Why Is This Important?

Understanding these concepts is crucial for writing efficient, maintainable, and error-free C++ programs. Mastery of these topics ensures that you can design and implement complex software systems using C++'s object-oriented features.

## Conclusion

C++ Module 04 takes your C++ skills to the next level by introducing you to advanced object-oriented programming techniques and effective memory management practices. By the end of this module, you should have a strong understanding of how to design robust, efficient, and maintainable C++ programs.
